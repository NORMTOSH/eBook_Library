The error you're encountering indicates that the Django module is not installed or not available in the Python environment you're using. This is a common issue if you're not using a virtual environment or if the virtual environment is not activated.

### Steps to Resolve the Issue:

1. **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment (Recommended):**

   It's a good practice to use a virtual environment to manage your project's dependencies. Here are the steps to create and activate one:

   1. Navigate to your project directory:

      ```sh
      cd /home/norman/Documents/ABYA_LMS/django_backend
      ```

   2. Create a virtual environment (if you haven't already):

      ```sh
      python3 -m venv env
      ```

   3. Activate the virtual environment:

      - On Linux and macOS:

        ```sh
        source env/bin/activate
        ```

      - On Windows:

        ```sh
        .\env\Scripts\activate
        ```

2. **Install Django in the Virtual Environment:**

   Once the virtual environment is activated, install Django and any other dependencies:

   ```sh
   pip install django
   ```

   If you have a `requirements.txt` file, you can install all dependencies listed there:

   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run Your Django Application:**

   With the virtual environment activated and Django installed, you should be able to run your Django application without issues:

   ```sh
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

### Summary of Commands:

1. Navigate to your project directory:

   ```sh
   cd /home/norman/Documents/ABYA_LMS/django_backend
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:

   ```sh
   python3 -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate  # On Linux and macOS
   # .\env\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
   ```

3. Install Django:

   ```sh
   pip install django
   ```

4. (Optional) Install all dependencies from `requirements.txt`:

   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. Run your Django application:

   ```sh
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

### Note:

If you already have a virtual environment but forgot to activate it, simply navigate to your project directory and activate the virtual environment using the `source` command as shown above. Then, try running your Django application again.
